Ever wanted to export a Godot app or project to an iPhone IPA without owning a Mac or renting a Mac in the cloud? This guide is for you!

Please give [my repository](https://github.com/mak448a/build-ios) a star on GitHub if this helps!


## Requirements
- gh CLI
- git
- Python

## Guide
1. Download [build-ios](https://github.com/mak448a/build-ios) with the following command.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mak448a/build-ios --depth=1
```
1. Change the current directory to build-ios with
```shell
cd build-ios
```
1. Install dependencies with the commands below. Choose the one for your operating system.

**Windows**
```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Linux**
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Visit https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps to get a token for using with the tool.

You can name your app whatever you want, as long as it's unique.

5. Run the Python script!
```shell
python main.py
```
6. When you launch the CLI with `python main.py`, it'll prompt you to choose whether you want to build or edit an IPA. For the first time, choose build IPA.

### Mode instructions
**Build IPA:**
- Follow the prompts.

**Edit IPA:**
- When exporting your Godot Project, choose "Export PCK/ZIP" and save it as `yourproject.pck`.

### But what's the difference?
- Build IPA is for the first time you run the CLI. It makes a fresh build of your project.
- Edit IPA is for afterwards. You can export with the PCK only, and it'll replace some of the files in the IPA. If you didn't change any settings in `project.godot`, it should work perfectly! If you did though, rebuild the IPA.



## Troubleshooting
If you get an `AuthError('expired_access_token', None))`, that means that you need to get a new OAuth token from Dropbox.
