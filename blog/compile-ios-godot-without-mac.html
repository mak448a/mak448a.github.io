        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Git installed on your computer</li>
            <li>A GitHub account</li>
            <li>Basic Git + GitHub knowledge</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 1: Setup GitHub repository</h2>
        <p>First, create a GitHub repository. You may want to set it to private. Pull it to a folder on your computer like so: <code>git pull (github.com/user/yourrepourl)</code></p>  
        <h2>Step 2: Create local GitHub repository</h2>
        <p>Download my starter repository <a href="https://github.com/mak448a/build-ios">here</a>. Next, copy the contents of that folder to your local repository.</p>
        <p>Open your local repository in your file manager and open to .github/workflows/build.yml. You may have to show hidden files if you're on Mac or Linux. Replace all occurences of "Example-Project" with your project name.</p>
        <p>Export your project using the iOS preset and shove the Xcode Project into your local repository. IMPORTANT! DO NOT INCLUDE SPACES IN YOUR EXPORT FILENAME!!!</p>
        <p>Run <code>git commit -m "Upload"</code> and <code>git push</code>.</p>
        <p>If you get an error saying that you have exceeded GitHub's upload limit, follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/mak448a/build-ios">here.</a></p>
        <h2>Step 3: Download your build</h2>
        <p>Visit your repository URL on GitHub and go to the Actions tab. Click on the topmost entry. If it is still yellow, wait a little longer. If it's green, scroll to the bottom and click the download button. You may have to refresh the page to see the download.</p>
